Shiny application that allows simulating steady-state response curves using the C3 and C4 photosynthesis models by Yin & Struik (2009, NJAS). 

The application runs by sourcing the file `RUNME.R` within an R session. An internet connection will be required the first time the application runs if dependencies are not available on the local environment. For more details read `Instructions.docx`.
